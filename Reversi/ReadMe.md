Reversi is a strategic board game. Each player has pieces with a
specific colour (light and dark).  The objective of the game is to have
more pieces on the board than the opponent by the end of the game.

## Rules

In the following, we briefly outline the rules of the game. At the
same time, note that this assessment follows the rules of the modern
version of Reversi which is referred to as Othello on
[Wikipedia](./Reversi.pdf) (section "Rules")
and these rules will be assumed while marking your assessments.

- Reversi is played by 2 players on an 8x8 board.

- Initially, there are 4 pieces on the board: two facing white side up
  and two pieces with the dark side up.

- Players can put a piece on the board only in such a position that
  creates at least one straight occupied line (horizontal, vertical,
  or diagonal) between the new piece and another piece of the same
  colour, with one or more of opponents' pieces in-between. Such
  pieces are flipped, i.e. change their colour.

- Dark makes the first move.

- Game continues as long as there are either empty squares or a legal
  move is possible. If a player does not have any legal moves, play
  passes back to another player. The game ends when neither player can
  move.
